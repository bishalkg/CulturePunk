## Sections

### Homepage
The user is welcomed to the app with an artistic landing page and hero statement, encouraging users/artists to become involved in a virtual community where they can showcase and sell their art pieces in the form on non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
The page is divided into four sections and includes:

* An animated sign up button takes you to a page where you can sign up for an account, and subsequently provide access to the live auction chat and bidding feature in the livestream page
* A section showing the current product drop and the livestream to auction off that product, showcasing the core livestream auction feature of the application soon after a user enters the app
* A section that showcases a creative, expandable, carousel of upcoming events, which the user can sign up for on the calendar page. It also includes a carousel of trending art pieces. 
* The final section is an informative embedded youtube video that allows the users/artists to learn more about NFTs and get up to speed on how they can sell their artwork with digital transactions.
