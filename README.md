<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

CulturePunk is the world’s most collaborative and dynamic marketplace for art acquisition. We empower our international community of collectors and newbies to discover, access, acquire, and consign digital art and crypto art assets. Inspired by our forward-thinking vision of innovation, we host live auctions and product drops at the intersection of art and technology.

By honoring our collective lived experiences in a virtual world, we re-imagine an art space that operates to serve and see everyone. *We are artists. We are you.*

## Sections

### Homepage
The user is welcomed to the app with an artistic landing page and hero statement, encouraging users/artists to become involved in a virtual community where they can showcase and sell their art pieces in the form on non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
The page is divided into four sections and includes:

* An animated sign up button takes you to a page where you can sign up for an account, and subsequently provide access to the live auction chat and bidding feature in the livestream page
* A section showing the current product drop and the livestream to auction off that product, showcasing the core livestream auction feature of the application soon after a user enters the app
* A section that showcases a creative, expandable, carousel of upcoming events, which the user can sign up for on the calendar page. It also includes a carousel of trending art pieces. 
* The final section is an informative embedded youtube video that allows the users/artists to learn more about NFTs and get up to speed on how they can sell their artwork with digital transactions.

</p>

### Events Calendar

Events Calendar section displays a calendar list of product drops and auctions. Users can add and delete events. Product drops and auctions are retrieved from a PostgreSQL database.

* The event carousel elegantly displays 3D dynamic cards for each product drop and auction drop. A toggle switch opens and closes the event carousel
* The text field and date picker are built with Material UI Library and the calendar was built with Big React Calendar
* The event calendar has CRUD functionality and is connected to a PostgreSQL database
* The event calendar can also be connected to a Firebase real time database for better integration and communication with other components that use Firebase.

### Livestream

### Gallery

In the NFT Art Gallery users can browse through selected works sourced from the OpenSea API. The work can be ordered by Last Sale, Token ID, or Number of Sales.

The page uses React Context to allow logged-in users to save their favorite pieces. When a user selects the favorite icon on an NFT card, identifying information for the art is stored in a Firebase database under their username. When the component renders, the token ID's pulled from OpenSea are checked agains the token IDs saved for the user in Firebase in order to determine which cards will appear with an active favorite icon.



### Chat & Auction
Chat and Auction section uses React Hooks and React Context to allow logged-in users to chat real-time and join the live auction. The UI design is implemented using Material UI. Live chat content and auction information are stored and retrieved using Google Firebase real-time database to ensure data persistence.

* Users can input chat content along with Emoji into the Live Chat section.
* Live auction system has CRUD functionalities and is displayed in a sorted descending order based on the bidding price.
